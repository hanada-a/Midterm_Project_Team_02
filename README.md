### To Do:
- 




## Challenges & Solutions
- This was our first time collaborating with multiple members across multiple branches. Through this project, we learned that it is possible.
- (Faculty) Invalid grade field text like "65.0fg" was saving because `Float.parseFloat()` would parse "65.0" and ignore the rest. Swapped to regex validation `\\d+(\\.\\d+)?` to ensure the entire String is numeric before parsing.

## Future Enhancements
- Further UI/UX Improvements
- Advanced searching and filtering
- (Faculty) Calculate overall course grade based on assignment grades
- (Faculty) Implement seats and seat assignments as separate classes so faculty can set a number of available seats
- (Faculty) Implement assignment due dates
-
